Subject: Immediate Resignation Due to Medical Reasons

Dear [HR's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I regret to inform you that I have recently met with an accident and am currently under medical care. Due to the nature of my condition, I am advised to rest and remain with my family for proper recovery and support.

Given these unforeseen circumstances, I am left with no option but to tender my resignation from my current internship role with immediate effect. I have also attached the relevant medical documents for your reference.

While I was already in the process of planning a transition due to a career opportunity in my hometown, this health situation has accelerated the need for immediate release.

I sincerely thank you and the organization for the opportunity and the valuable experience Iâ€™ve gained during my time here. I truly appreciate your support and understanding in this matter.

Please let me know if any formalities are required from my end.

Warm regards,
Vijender Singh
